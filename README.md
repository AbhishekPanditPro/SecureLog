# ToDo
- done - Set up github for both of us.
- done - Build basic hello world application.

- Decide on OS. Nick is working on windows atm, but he can reinstall linux on his computers if needed. (Abhishek is in Unix - anything can work until the program works)
- Connect on Discord (Done)
- Find program requirements.

# Ideas
- Make sure Github is secure and can not be hacked.
- Create a Validator function that checks all input from the user
